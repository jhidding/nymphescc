If you're reading this, you are considering to contribute to this project, great! I'd like to set a few guidelines, depending on the kind of contribution:

0. Literate programming: This software is made using Literate Programming in mind. You need to be running [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io/) when making changes to the code. The documentation is generated using Pandoc.
1. Bug fixes: before you start coding, touch base. Please submit an issue clearly stating the bug, how it is triggered and arrive at a proposed fix. Then you can submit a PR that is limited to only fixing that single bug.
2. Features: I've taken great care to keep the interface of NymphesCC intuitive. As such, you need to come up with good arguments for new features.
3. Documentation: documentation is king and there is always too little. I welcome PR's for documentation, no previous issue needed.
